# My Small Angular implementation
There are some methods in the module:
- **`directive`** `(attrName, callback)` - accepts a  name and a callback and registers a directive
- **`compile`** `(node)` - accepts a node, checks directives on it and applies them
- **`bootstrap`** `([node])` - initializes the application start. Accepts a node or has the default node with attribute `ng-app`
